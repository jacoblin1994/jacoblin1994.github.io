      <description>What is in scope?   Command-Line Tools  Zsh Oh My Zsh Powerlevel10k tmux vim   IDE Tools  VSC   Configuration Files  Why do I care?  Having a consistent workflow for development reduces friction when switching to a new machine, hence increasing developer velocity.
How to do it?  Install Zsh Zsh is an extended version of the Bourne Shell (sh) like Bash, but it offers more easily configurable options especially when paired with Oh My Zsh.</description>

      <description>What is this blog?  This blog is a static website that returns the same hard-coded content from the server whenever a particular resource is requested. A dynamic website, on the other hand, is one where some of the response content is generated dynamically. Learn more about static vs dynamic sites here.
Why do I care?  This helps provide a concrete introduction to web development that consists of myriad components, including domain acquisition, web file hosting, web file composition (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and etc.</description>

      <description>Why do I care?  One thing I realized after college is that life is a learning journey that never ends. Given the rapidly changing world, it is almost always the case that what you learn in the traditional four-year college program cannot suffice the constantly changing needs forever.
In fact, it might quite be the contrary that what you are taught in school is rarely used.

      <description>What is it?  The Golden Circle is a model developed by Simon Sinek in his book, Start with Why, which talks about the concept that
 people are inspired by a sense of purpose (or &amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo;), and that this should come first when communicating, before &amp;ldquo;How&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rdquo;
 And the scale of which could range from individuals to organizations.
Now that we address What the Golden Circle is, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about How and Why it is important next.</description>
