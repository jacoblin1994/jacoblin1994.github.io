      <description>Why do I care?  One thing I realized after college is that life is a learning journey that never ends. Given the rapidly changing world, it is almost always the case that what you learn in the traditional four-year college program cannot suffice the constantly changing needs forever.
In fact, it might quite be the contrary that what you are taught in school is rarely used. This is not to discredit the importance of education but rather it is the learning process that really counts because the knowledge could itself become outdated yet the process by which you learn is here to stay and get you &amp;lsquo;sync&amp;rsquo;d&amp;rsquo; or relevant.</description>

 people are inspired by a sense of purpose (or &amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo;), and that this should come first when communicating, before &amp;ldquo;How&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rdquo;
 And the scale of which could range from individuals to organizations.
Now that we address What the Golden Circle is, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about How and Why it is important next.</description>
